# AGENTS.md

Instructions for AI agents working with this codebase.

## Reading Protocol

**MUST**:
- Read `outline.md` before exploring large files
- Check `memory.md` for warnings and business rules
- Start from entry points listed below

**ALWAYS**:
- Respect existing patterns in the codebase
- Check for TODOs before implementing new features in the same area
- Verify changes don't violate documented invariants

**NEVER**:
- Skip reading `memory.md` warnings before modifying related code
- Ignore SAFETY comments in unsafe blocks
- Delete TODO/FIXME without resolving or consulting

---

## Large Files (Consult outline.md)

These files exceed the line threshold. Use `outline.md` for symbol maps:

| File | Lines | Language |
| ---- | ----- | -------- |
| `order.php` | 100 | Php |

## Critical Files (Review memory.md First)

These files contain high-priority warnings or business rules:

| File | High-Priority Markers |
| ---- | --------------------- |
| `order.php` | 5 |
