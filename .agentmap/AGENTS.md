# AGENTS.md

Instructions for AI agents working with this codebase.

## Reading Protocol

**MUST**:
- Read `outline.md` before exploring large files
- Check `memory.md` for warnings and business rules
- Start from entry points listed below

**ALWAYS**:
- Respect existing patterns in the codebase
- Check for TODOs before implementing new features in the same area
- Verify changes don't violate documented invariants

**NEVER**:
- Skip reading `memory.md` warnings before modifying related code
- Ignore SAFETY comments in unsafe blocks
- Delete TODO/FIXME without resolving or consulting

## Entry Points

Start reading the codebase from these files:

- `src/lib.rs`
- `src/main.rs`

## Hub Files (High Import Count)

These files are imported by many others. Changes here have wide impact:

| File | Imported By |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `types` | 22 files |
| `analyze` | 15 files |
| `once_cell` | 13 files |
| `regex` | 13 files |
| `std` | 11 files |
| `super` | 6 files |
| `serde` | 5 files |
| `anyhow` | 4 files |
| `memory` | 3 files |
| `scan` | 3 files |
